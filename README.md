# Welcome to User Authentication System

Hey there! This is a simple user authentication system built in Python. It helps you manage user authentication tasks like signing up, logging in, and resetting passwords.

## What Can It Do?

- **Sign Up**: If you're new here, you can create an account by choosing a username and a password. Just make sure your password is at least 6 characters long.
- **Login**: Already have an account? Great! Just enter your username and password to access your account.
- **Password Reset**: Forgot your password? No worries! You can reset it. We'll make sure you're not a robot by asking you to solve a little puzzle.

2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4. Run the script by typing `python user_authentication_system.py` and hitting Enter.
5. Follow the prompts on the screen to sign up, log in, or reset your password.
